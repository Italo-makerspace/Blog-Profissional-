                <p>Guilherme Oliveira Araujo is a young, aspiring programmer currently studying Systems Development at SENAI. Born on March 16, 2009, his journey began with significant challenges as a premature baby born at 28-29 weeks, facing cardiovascular issues and recurrent episodes of facial paralysis until the age of five.</p>
                <p>Despite these initial adversities, Guilherme enrolled at the SESI Antônio Scalon school at age five with a scholarship, marking the start of an inspiring academic journey. During this period, he began studying English and engaged in various extracurricular activities, including martial arts (Jiu-Jitsu and later Muay Thai), as well as guitar and violin lessons.</p>
                <p>In the 7th grade, Guilherme discovered his interest in Academic Olympiads. In his very first competition, he won a gold medal at the OBA (Brazilian Astronomy Olympiad). The following year, he repeated this achievement by winning the ONEE (National Olympiad for Energy Efficiency), also securing a gold medal. In the 9th grade, he was again awarded a medal at the OBMEP (Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad of Public Schools).</p>
                <p>Demonstrating immense curiosity and discipline, he decided to learn a new language each year—Japanese, French, and German, respectively—until his sophomore year of high school. He is currently studying Systems Development at SENAI, where he actively participates in WorldSkills, an international competition that highlights talented young technical and professional individuals.</p>
                <p>Guilherme constantly seeks to enhance his skills in technology and aims for a solid career as a programmer with a focus on innovation and social impact. Determined, curious, and persistent, he believes that every challenge is an opportunity for growth and overcoming obstacles.</p>
